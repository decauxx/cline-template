- **ADR.md**: Architecture Decision Records
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Project change tracking

### Memory Bank (`memory-bank/`)
Cline AI assistant memory storage with configuration rules for persistent context.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Copy template to your new project
cp -r cline-template/ your-new-project/
cd your-new-project/

# Initialize your project
git init
```

### 2. Customize Rules
Edit `.clinerules/coding.md` and `.clinerules/documentation.md` to match your project's specific requirements:

- Adjust coding standards for your tech stack
- Modify documentation requirements
- Add project-specific guidelines

### 3. Initialize Documentation
- Insert your project brief in `memory-bank/projectBrief.md`
- Ask Cline to "intialize memory bank" and update docs (including this README, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/ADR.md`)  

### 4. Start Development
The Cline AI assistant will automatically use the rules and guidelines defined in `.clinerules/` to:

- Follow your coding standards
- Maintain consistent code quality
- Generate appropriate documentation
- Track changes properly

## 📋 Features

- **🎨 Comprehensive Coding Standards**: Modern best practices for JavaScript/TypeScript, UI/UX, and full-stack development
- **📚 Documentation Framework**: Structured approach to maintaining project documentation
- **🧠 Memory Management**: Configured memory bank for Cline AI assistant context persistence
- **🏗️ Architecture Guidance**: Templates for documenting technical decisions
- **🔄 Change Tracking**: Standardized changelog format for version management

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write clear, readable code with descriptive naming
- Prefer functions over classes in modern JavaScript/TypeScript
- Extract reusable logic into focused, small functions
